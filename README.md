# ContactsApp

This application is a good way for handling your contacts! It is easy and simple to use, employing CRUD functions.

When you have downloaded this project file, go to the src file with your command console and run the commands "javac ContactsApp.java" and "java ContactsApp" and you're good to go!

In the middle of the main frame is the list that will show all the contacts you add. All the contacts are stored in the contacts.csv file.

To add new contacts, click the "Add" button and fill the text fields for contact information. Filling address and email are optional while other personal information is required, otherwise a contact cannot be added. There also cannot be any duplicate IDs.

In order to add new contacts, you need to pass validation checks. Each personal information type has it own unique requirements. The current version of the application accepts only Finnish model for the National Identification Number. Please familiarize yourself with in order to pass the validation check. You need to enter a capital letter first, when entering names (using dash is allowed). The phone numbers need to be given with a Finnish mobile phone prefix (+358) or with a regional number prefix (01-09). Address is optional, but it needs to follow the following model, if added: "street name, number, capital letter, number. Email is optional, but if added, has to follow the conventional model.

Editting contacts have to follow similar validation checks, only ID is unchangeable. To edit a contact, simply click on a contact from the list component and then click the "Edit" button.

Deleting function works similarly as edit, where you have to first select a contact, then a new for window deletion appears and a user is prompted for confirmation before deleting a contact with a pop up window with options.

There is also a search bar that helps you find contacts when entering contact's id in the text field.

Enjoy using the application!
